\\ Thanks for stopping by! I'm a researcher at the [Bennett Institute for Public Policy, University of Cambridge](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/).

## A little bit about me

I help bring dictators down.

In my previous life, I was an economist doing all sorts of things.

I hold an MPhil in Public Policy from the University of Cambridge and a BSc in Economics from the London School of Economics.

My first name is Musaddiq, but I go by my middle name ðŸ™‚
