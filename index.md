Welcome to my personal webpage, thanks for stopping by!

## A little bit about me 🖖

I'm a data scientist at the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/). Previously, I was researcher at the [Bennett Institute for Public Policy, University of Cambridge](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/), working with [Professor Diane Coyle](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/about-us/team/diane-coyle/) to better understand institutional structures responsible for industrial and economic policies in the UK, part of the wider work run by [the Productivity Institute](https://www.productivity.ac.uk/). I dabbled in the use of text as data in economics research, analysing stuff from government policy documents and to patent publications 🤓 Other than that, I helped [Dr Pieter van Houten](https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/Staff_and_Students/dr-pieter-van-houten)'s supervise his undergraduate statistics course, introducing students to the amazing world of [R (and Python, if they ask)](https://www.business-science.io/assets/2021-02-18-R-is-for-research/Join_Forces_meme.png) 📊 Prior to that, I was an economist within Malaysia's policymaking circles, meandering in all sorts of economics-related fields from trade policy to public finance management.

I think it's fair to say that I've had a rather unconventional career trajectory—my professional experiences took place in the days leading to and following from the [Malaysia's landmark 2018 general elections](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44036178) (i.e. the elections that ended the country's 61-year one-party rule since her independence from Britain in 1957):
* I started out as a researcher at the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund’s research institute, where I dabbled in things ranging from international trade negotiations to analysing socio-economic development of the country.
* After Malaysia's historic 2018 elections, I did my bit to help out with what I can as an officer at the Prime Minister's advisory council ([Malaysia's Council of Eminent Persons](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Malaysia-in-transition/Meet-the-5-brains-behind-Malaysia-s-Mahathir-nomics)).
* This was followed by a small intermission period in my public service career, where I joined the private sector as an economist for a bank under [Dr Donald Hanna](https://www.cimb.com/en/newsroom/2017/cimb-appoints-dr-donald-hanna-as-group-chief-economist.html).
* Rejoined the public sector as an economist for [Malaysia's capital market regulator](https://www.sc.com.my/), working in all sorts of things for the government up until the early days of the pandemic.

Throughout this whole time, I've had the great privilege of working with some truly fantastic people, such as [Allen Ng](https://twitter.com/elanorng) and [Professor Jomo Kwame Sundaram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jomo_Kwame_Sundaram). Their dedication to public service and betterment of society are beyond praise.

I hold an MPhil in Public Policy from the University of Cambridge and a BSc in Economics from the London School of Economics. These were made possible through generous funding from scholarships, of which I am deeply grateful: [Tunku Fund](https://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/research/tunku/former-scholars/Adam-Muhtar) and [Khazanah Scholarship](https://www.yayasankhazanah.com.my/scholarship-programmes/khazanah-global-scholarship).

Some extra bits about myself: 
* I split my time between London and Cambridge. If you'd like to meet up, let me know via 🐦[Twitter](https://twitter.com/adammuhtar_) or ✉️[Email](mailto:adam.b.muhtar@gmail.com).
* My first name is Musaddiq, but I go by my middle name, Adam 🙂
* I'm also interested in ways to [ween off economists' reliance on Stata](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/858/619/19d) 🙃
