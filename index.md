They in turn which were generously funded by scholarships: [Tunku Fund](https://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/tunku-abdul-rahman-fund) and [Khazanah Global Scholarhip](https://www.yayasankhazanah.com.my/scholarship-programmes/khazanah-global-scholarship).

Some extra titbits about myself: 
* I split my time between London (with my amazing [wife](https://www.faridahfaiz.com/)) and Cambridge. If you'd like to meet up, let me know via 🐦[twitter](https://twitter.com/adammuhtar_) or ✉️[email](mailto:adam.b.muhtar@gmail.com).
* My first name is Musaddiq, but I go by my middle name, Adam 🙂
* Massive LotR fan—[Amazon's upcoming show](https://twitter.com/lotronprime) has got me [super pumped](https://i.redd.it/3kq3mcr9x3f71.jpg) 🥳
