Welcome to my personal webpage, thanks for stopping by! ✨

I'm using this website as a space to "[work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu)", showcasing the stuff I've been working on and the process I go through to get there 👨‍🏭

## Things I'm working on 👨‍💻

I'll update this bit fairly soon!

## A little bit about me 🖖

I'm a researcher at the [Bennett Institute for Public Policy, University of Cambridge](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/), working under the supervision of the incredible [Professor Diane Coyle](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/about-us/team/diane-coyle/). We're doing our bit to better understand productivity in the UK, which is part of the wider work run by [the Productivity Institute](https://www.productivity.ac.uk/).

Prior to my current work, I had been an economist within Malaysia's policymaking circles, meandering in all sorts of economics-related stuff from trade policy to public finance management. I think it's fair to say that I've had a rather unconventional career trajectory—my professional experiences coincided the days leading to and following from the Malaysia's landmark 2018 general elections (the elections that ended the country's 61-year one-party rule since her independence from Britain in 1957):
* I started out as a researcher at the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund’s research institute, where I dabbled in things ranging from international trade negotiations to analysing socio-economic development of the country.
* After 🇲🇾's historic 2018 elections, I did my bit to help out with what I can as an officer at the Prime Minister's advisory council ([Malaysia's Council of Eminent Persons](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Malaysia-in-transition/Meet-the-5-brains-behind-Malaysia-s-Mahathir-nomics)).
* A small intermission period in my public service career, where I joined the private sector as an economist for a bank under [Dr Donald Hanna](https://www.cimb.com/en/newsroom/2017/cimb-appoints-dr-donald-hanna-as-group-chief-economist.html).
* Rejoined the public sector as an economist for [Malaysia's capital market regulator](https://www.sc.com.my/), working in all sorts of things for the government up until the early days of the pandemic.
Throughout this whole time, I've had the great privilege of working with some truly fantastic people, such as [Allen Ng](https://twitter.com/elanorng) and [Professor Jomo Kwame Sundaram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jomo_Kwame_Sundaram). Their dedication to public service and betterment of society are beyond praise.

I hold an MPhil in Public Policy from the University of Cambridge and a BSc in Economics from the London School of Economics. These were made possible through generous funding from scholarships, of which I am deeply grateful: [Tunku Fund](https://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/tunku-abdul-rahman-fund) and [Khazanah Global Scholarhip](https://www.yayasankhazanah.com.my/scholarship-programmes/khazanah-global-scholarship).

Some extra bits about myself: 
* I split my time between London (with my amazing [wife](https://www.faridahfaiz.com/)) and Cambridge. If you'd like to meet up, let me know via 🐦[Twitter](https://twitter.com/adammuhtar_) or ✉️[email](mailto:adam.b.muhtar@gmail.com).
* My first name is Musaddiq, but I go by my middle name, Adam 🙂
* Massive LotR fan—[Amazon's upcoming show](https://twitter.com/lotronprime) has got me [super pumped](https://i.redd.it/3kq3mcr9x3f71.jpg) 🥳
